# fire-render

A project for a shader programming course using GLSL. Renders a burning piece of paper. Apparantly re-discovered the volume ray casting rendering technique, without having studied any data visualization - lots of fun!

Made in January 2011.

## Usage

Simply open in RenderMonkey, click around to start da fire! You might have to make sure Fire3 points to the MyFire.png file, and paper_texture paper_texture.jpg file. Also, won't work with certain versions of OpenGL.
